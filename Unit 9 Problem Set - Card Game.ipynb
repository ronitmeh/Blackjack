    "There are thirteen different ranks, from Ace to King. There are four different suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. So, to know everything about a single card you need its rank and its suit. In card games such as blackjack, where the cards are worth a certain number of points, it is also helpful to have a third variable, called value that is an integer related to a card's rank. The values of the cards are [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11], respectively (meaning, the Jack, King, Queen, and 10 have a value of 10 and the Ace has a value of 11 or sometimes 1).\n",

    "### Adding Features to your Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-XIjDr33Mo) think of some features not mentioned above that you could add to your game to make it more like a real game of Blackjack.  Some ideas include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real Blackjack, the value of an ace can be chosen to have a value of 1 or 11, depending on what is optimal. Edit your program so that aces have this flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement the option to bet on your hand against the dealer (computer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have the option of multiple players\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a cool ASCII splash screen to the start of your game\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of printing the cards as \"Four of Hearts\" create an image or ASCII art for each card or use the Unicode symbol for the suits, e.g.: `print(\"\\U0001F0B3\") # three of hearts!`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement the ability to \"split a hand\" if you get dealt the same value card for your first two cards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other gameplay ideas of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "DOCUMENT THESE EXTRA FEATURES HERE FOR BONUS POINTS:\n",

    "    1. Unicode Cards\n",
    "    2. Player can bet\n",
